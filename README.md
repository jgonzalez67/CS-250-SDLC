    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
      I think its important to understand value for this. Value may depend on the project but in essence, its what is going to benefit the client the most. User-stories help in this because those come directly          from the user, and it comes in their terms and persepectives. This can help in understand in lamens terms what they want, and to determine what is the most important in that case. 
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
      It depends, as we learned sometime a Waterfall approach may be good, other times Agile is the move. Agile in programming specifically may be favorable in most situations however there may be times when its       not needed. I definetly think the testing early and often is important to incorperate, as well as being transparent. Seeking assistance when its needed, and making sure we collborate as a team. 
      
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
      May have gotten ahead of myself in that last question but I think being a good team member means being open to collboration. Helping team members who are not as strong as other without judgment or                attitude. Being transparent, and not trying to hide failures, which could delay the team. All of these combined I beleive make a strong, and good team member
